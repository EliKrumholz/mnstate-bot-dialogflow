These classes are often called Gateway Courses. The tutors attend class and hold organized office hours 3-4 times a week outside of the regular class time. Instructors request tutors to be in their specific classes. The tutors are students who have already taken the class, earned a good grade, and been recommended by the instructor to tutor their class. If you are interested in having a TLC Tutor in your class or are interested in becoming a TLC Tutor, have your instructor contact:\n\nJackie Reichter\nPeer Tutoring and TLC Coordinator\n651-779-3285 or jackie.reichter@century.edu\n-OR-\nKeith Hagen\nPeer Tutoring and TLC Coordinator\n651-779-3293 or keith.hagen@century.edu"
