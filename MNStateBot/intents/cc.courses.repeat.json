You may petition to repeat using a substitute course if the original course is not available. You must fill out a \"Repeat of Course\" form and turn it into the Records Office.\nhttps://www.century.edu/sites/default/files/records-repeatofcourse.pdf\n\nNote:  If you plan on transferring to another institution, you will want to see how your repeated grade will be considered.  It may be possible that both grades will be calculated."
